Overview Of The Gameplay
------------------------

Battleship is a two-player game that uses grid references to try and sink the other players ships. Each player has five ships of varying sizes that they can place anywhere on the map at the start of a game. Players take it in turn to guess where the enemy ships are. Each player marks the guessed locations on their own map with either hit or miss markers. The winner is the first person to sink all the enemyâ€™s ships.
