In-Game Screen
---------------

Once starting a game, users will have two maps displayed on the top and bottom of the screen. The bottom map will be where they place their ships and the enemies attack markers where as the top map will have the markers that show your hits and misses on the enemy team. Down the left hand side will be a container which will hold the missed markers and down the right will hold the markers which indicated any hits the enemy has had. Players can take a marker from one of the trays and place it onto either map to mark the movements by either themselves or the opposition.
